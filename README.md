Concise Greedy Dependency Parser (in Scala)
===========================================

This Dependency Parser was inspired by the following two blog posts : 

  * http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/a-good-part-of-speechpos-tagger-in-about-200-lines-of-python/

  * http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/a-simple-fast-algorithm-for-natural-language-dependency-parsing/

This version includes none of the original code, but inherits the same minimalist ideals, in Scala.

There's a much more complete system (which extends over very many more files, however) 
at Matthew Honnibal  (the original author's) GitHub account : https://github.com/syllog1sm/redshift.  



It is currently a *work-in-progress*
--------------------------------------

I'll update this readme when there's something that is actually testable.
